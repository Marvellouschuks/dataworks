<section class="flex-1 md:mr-20">In our upcoming beta release, we're launching key protocol features to a select group of users. The initial phase focuses on testing our core infrastructure components and resource allocation engine. Early participants will interact with our computational marketplace using  $DATA tokens.
<br><br><br>
During this phase, we're validating hardware-level security measures on our AMD EPYC processors and fine-tuning the allocation engine. Users can run various workloads from enterprise applications to AI training, helping us optimize performance metrics and resource distribution.

    The beta introduces graduated stress testing, starting with controlled workloads before expanding to more complex operations. This methodical approach ensures system stability and security before our full protocol launch. Selected participants will receive detailed documentation and direct support throughout the testing period.
